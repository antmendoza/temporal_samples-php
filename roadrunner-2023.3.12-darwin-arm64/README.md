RoadRunner is an open-source (MIT licensed) high-performance PHP application server, process manager written in Go and powered with plugins ‚ù§Ô∏è.
It supports running as a service with the ability to extend its functionality on a per-project basis with plugins.


# Features

**RoadRunner** features a range of plugins, including `HTTP(S)/2/3` and `fCGI` servers that are compatible with PSR-7/PSR-17 standards. This is just one of its many capabilities. It serves as an effective alternative to the traditional Nginx+FPM setup, providing improved performance and more flexibility. Its extensive plugin options go far beyond just `HTTP(S)/2/3` and `fCGI` servers, offering a broad range of functionalities:
- Queue drivers: RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS, Beanstalk, NATS, In-Memory.
- KV drivers: Redis, Memcached, BoltDB, In-Memory.
- OpenTelemetry protocol support (`gRPC`, `http`, `jaeger`).
- [Workflow engine](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php) via [Temporal](https://temporal.io).
- `gRPC` server. For increased speed, the `protobuf` extension can be used.
- `HTTP(S)/2/3` and `fCGI` servers features **automatic TLS management**, **103 Early Hints** support and middleware like: Static, Headers, gzip, prometheus (metrics), send (x-sendfile), OTEL, proxy_ip_parser, etc.
- Embedded distribute lock plugin which manages access to shared resources.
- Metrics server (you might easily expose your own).
- WebSockets and Broadcast via [Centrifugo](https://centrifugal.dev) server.
- Systemd-like services manager with auto-restarts, execution time limiter, etc.
- Production-ready.
- And more üòâ

# Installation

The easiest way to get the latest RoadRunner version is to use one of the pre-built release binaries, which are available for
OSX, Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. Instructions for using these binaries are on the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/releases).

## Docker:

To get the roadrunner binary file you can use our docker image: `ghcr.io/roadrunner-server/roadrunner:2023.X.X` (more information about
image and tags can be found [here](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/pkgs/container/roadrunner)).

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/roadrunner-server/roadrunner:2023.X.X AS roadrunner
FROM php:8.2-cli

COPY --from=roadrunner /usr/bin/rr /usr/local/bin/rr

# USE THE RR
```

Configuration located in the `.rr.yaml` file ([full sample](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/blob/master/.rr.yaml)):


## Installation via Composer
You can also install RoadRunner automatically using the command shipped with the composer package, run:

```bash
composer require spiral/roadrunner-cli
./vendor/bin/rr get-binary
```

Server binary will be available at the root of your project.

> **Note**
>
> PHP's extensions `php-curl` and `php-zip` are required to download RoadRunner automatically.
> PHP's extensions `php-sockets` need to be installed to run roadrunner.
> Check with `php --modules` your installed extensions.


## Installation option for the Debian-derivatives (Ubuntu, Mint, MX, etc)

```bash
wget https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/releases/download/v2023.X.X/roadrunner-2023.X.X-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i roadrunner-2023.X.X-linux-amd64.deb
```

## Download the latest release via curl:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/master/download-latest.sh | sh
```

## MacOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
brew install roadrunner
```

---

Configuration can be located in `.rr.yaml` file ([full sample](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/blob/master/.rr.yaml)):

```yaml
version: '3'

rpc:
  listen: tcp://127.0.0.1:6001

server:
  command: "php worker.php"

http:
  address: "0.0.0.0:8080"

logs:
  level: error
```

> Read more in [Documentation](https://docs.roadrunner.dev).

Example Worker:
--------

```php
<?php

use Spiral\RoadRunner;
use Nyholm\Psr7;

include "vendor/autoload.php";

$worker = RoadRunner\Worker::create();
$psrFactory = new Psr7\Factory\Psr17Factory();

$worker = new RoadRunner\Http\PSR7Worker($worker, $psrFactory, $psrFactory, $psrFactory);

while ($req = $worker->waitRequest()) {
    try {
        $rsp = new Psr7\Response();
        $rsp->getBody()->write('Hello world!');

        $worker->respond($rsp);
    } catch (\Throwable $e) {
        $worker->getWorker()->error((string)$e);
    }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you see the `EOF` error, check that you have installed the PHP packages from [this step](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner#installation-via-composer).
> If this does not help, try to execute the command `php worker.php` directly and check the output.
